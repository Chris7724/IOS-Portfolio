### The first thing I created while in this IOS class was a simple black-jack game. I created it in Swift and it used some simple game mechanics and images to work.The link to it is here: ?????.

### The main portion of this class I spent with a group of my fellow classmates while working on a tower defense game. The link to it is here: ????. The game is called Protect the Park and is duck vs goose themed. The geese attempt to follow a path set in the background of the screen while the ducks attempt to stop them. You must place and upgrade your ducks to protect the breadcrumb pile at the end of the path that the geese are attempting to reach. We encoutered various errors throughout the programming of this app. insert screenshots of game.
