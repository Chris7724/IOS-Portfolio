# IOS-Portfolio - Chris Thompson

### The first thing I created while in this IOS class was a simple black-jack game. I created it in Swift and it used some simple game mechanics and images to work.The link to it is here: ?????. 
# 
### The main portion of this class I spent with a group of my fellow classmates while working on a tower defense game. The link to it is here: ????. The game is called Protect the Park and is duck vs goose themed. The geese attempt to follow a path set in the background of the screen while the ducks attempt to stop them. You must place and upgrade your ducks to protect the breadcrumb pile at the end of the path that the geese are attempting to reach. We encoutered various errors throughout the programming of this app. insert screenshots of game.

### Previously I have taken AP Computer Science Principles, AP Java, and cybersecurity. These classes have provided me with valuable programming experiance. 
# 
#### During my time in AP Computer Science Principles I used block coding to create an app similar to Pong where you would shoot a ball at a moving line and attpemp to hit it. When it was hit it would become smaller, so the next time you tried to hit it, it would be more difficult. The game would reset the size of the line when the ball missed it.
# 
### During the AP Java Class I learned the fundamentals to programming and I created many prorgrams both individually and as a group. 
# During cybersecurity I worked with multiple programming laguages such as Python and HTML. I created programms as a group and individually.
